CISC/CMPE 457 Assignment 3

Due Friday March 17 at noon

In this assignment you take an image, build its sinogram, then filter
the sinogram, then reconstruct the image using the filtered
backprojection algorithm.

1. Get the main.py code running.  You run it as

      python3 main.py <image>

   using one of the images in the 'images' directory.

   Press 's' to compute the sinogram from the image.
   Press 'b' to compute the backprojection from the sinogram.
   Press 'f' to compute the filtered sinogram.

   You can run the code non-interactively as

      python3 main.py <image> sino.png bp.png sinoFiltered.png bpFiltered.png

   to get the output as the four files named above.  You can provide
   your own filenames instead.

2. Implement the three functions

      buildSinogram()
      computeFilteredSinogram()
      computeBackprojection()

   according to the comments above those functions in main.py.

3. Use the non-interactive command above to get an image of the foot
   backprojection with numSinoAngles = 64.  Name that image 'footBP.png'.

4. Answer these questions:

      Q1. What is a good 'numSinoAngles' for filtered backprojections,
          after which point adding more angles does not perceptibly
          improve image quality?

      Q2. Why does the backprojected image have a circle around
          everything?

   Put your answers in your README.txt file.

To submit:

   In a single directory called 'a3' put the following THREE files:

      README.txt - containing the name, student number, and netID of
		   each person working on the assignment.  Include
		   here any comments you have for the TA.  Include
		   your answers to the questions in step 4 above.

      main.py    - the modified code, well organized and well commented.

      footBP.png - the backprojection image of the foot from Step 3 above.

   YOU WILL LOSE 1 MARK IF YOU INCLUDE ANY OTHER FILES OR NAME YOUR
   DIRECTORY SOMETHING OTHER THAN a3.  In particular, do NOT include
   the 'images' directory, and do NOT include any OSX-specific
   directories (e.g. '__MACOSX').  If you are using OSX, you WILL NOT
   SEE __MACOSX, but it will be there and you will lose a mark.  Check
   your archive on a non-OSX system before submitting it.

   Zip that a3 directory and submit it through OnQ.
